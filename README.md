# Fixed-Income RFQ Trading Platform

A SpringBoot monolith simulating a **fixed-income Request-for-Quote (RFQ) trading platform**.

Technologies used:
 - Java 11, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
 - H2 in-memory database
 - Maven

- [Fixed-Income RFQ Trading Platform](#fixed-income-rfq-trading-platform)
  - [Domain Entities](#domain-entities)
  - [REST Endpoints](#rest-endpoints)
  - [Seed Data](#seed-data)
  - [Running the Application](#running-the-application)
  - [Testing](#testing)

## Domain Entities

Three domain entities:
 - **Counterparty**
   - name
   - lei (Legal Entity Identifier)
   - creditLimit (BigDecimal)
   - availableCredit (BigDecimal)
 - **Bond**
   - isin (unique, e.g. US912828YK15)
   - issuer
   - couponRate (BigDecimal)
   - maturityDate (LocalDate)
   - availableNotional (BigDecimal — par amount available for trading)
 - **RFQ** (Request for Quote)
   - counterparty (manyToOne)
   - bond (manyToOne)
   - notionalAmount (BigDecimal — par amount requested)
   - side (BUY / SELL)
   - status (PENDING / QUOTED / EXECUTED / REJECTED)
   - executionPrice (BigDecimal — total settlement amount)
   - createdAt (Instant)

Counterparty and Bond must be in place before executing an RFQ. If the bond has insufficient available notional or the counterparty has insufficient available credit, an exception will be thrown. The core logic is in `RFQExecutionSaga.java`, which attempts to execute an RFQ in a single transaction.

A PATCH method endpoint exists for both `Counterparty` and `Bond` controllers to update credit / notional inventory.

A trade confirmation is sent to a counterparty whenever credit is added, handled by `TradeConfirmationService.java`.

## Seed Data

On startup the application loads:
- **Counterparty**: Acme Asset Management (LEI: 549300EXAMPLE12345678, credit limit: $50,000,000)
- **Bond**: US Treasury 2.75% 11/15/2030 (ISIN: US912828YK15, available notional: $100,000,000)
- **RFQ**: BUY $5,000,000 notional at $4,987,500 — status EXECUTED

## Running the Application

```bash
cd monolith
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application starts on port `8080`. Hit `/counterparties`, `/bonds`, and `/rfqs` to verify the REST endpoints.

Open http://localhost:8080 for the workshop console. It displays the current
counterparty credit, bond inventory, RFQ ticket, and executed RFQs. All assets
are served by Spring Boot; Node, Docker, and external market-data services are
not required.

On Windows PowerShell, run `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` from `monolith`.
Use JDK 11 and check `./mvnw --version` (Windows: `.\mvnw.cmd --version`)
before starting. Stop the server and start it again to reset the in-memory H2
data.

The reference console includes **Preview eligibility**. `POST /rfqs/preview`
accepts the same ticket fields as `POST /rfqs`: positive `counterpartyId` and
`bondId`, positive `notionalAmount` and `executionPrice`, and `side` (`BUY` or
`SELL`). Invalid requests return 400; unknown resources return 404.

A valid preview returns 200 with `eligible`, `reasons`, `availableCredit`,
`availableNotional`, `remainingCredit`, and `remainingNotional`. It reports
`INSUFFICIENT_NOTIONAL` and/or `INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT` without changing balances
or saving an RFQ. Exact capacity is eligible. Negative remaining capacity
shows a shortfall.

Preview is advisory and reserves nothing. Execution still runs the existing
transaction against current state. This exercise does not provide concurrent
reservation, execution idempotency, or production trading controls.

This is a training simulation. The seed RFQ is historical display data and does
not deduct from the opening balances. `executionPrice` is the total settlement
amount, not a unit price. The simplified execution model deducts credit and
notional for either BUY or SELL.

## Testing

```bash
cd monolith
./mvnw clean test
```

See `IntegrationTest.java` for the full set of use-cases covering RFQ execution, insufficient notional/credit, and missing counterparty/bond scenarios.
